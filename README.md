## About

An explorer app of the Github public API created on ReactJS configured from scratch, to learn how to create the basic structure of a React application and find out about important concepts link components, properties, state, hooks. Futhermore, we applied typescript to add static typing to the application.

*Tools:*

* Webpack
* Babel
* Webpack Dev server
* SASS
* Source Maps
* Fast Refresh

## Installation
1. Install it by running `yarn` in the project's root directory
2. Run the project with `yarn start`
3. Build the project with `yarn build`

## Notes
* As an exercise, this project wasn’t focused on advanced optimizations regarding data storage, processing, accessibility, scalability, cross-browser compatibility, etc. There’s still a lot to be done about it.
* As most projects, this one is not bug/error-free. If you find any bug or unexpected behavior, feel free to get in touch, here is my email - raphael.lima.coelho@gmail.com
